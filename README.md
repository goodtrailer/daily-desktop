# Daily Desktop
Modular Windows desktop wallpaper updater that works daily at a set time. Wallpapers are provided by [IProvider](/DailyDesktop.Core/Providers/IProvider.cs) classes that are implemented in DLL modules. For example, look at [/DailyDesktop.Core.Providers.MTG/](/DailyDesktop.Core.Providers.MTG/), which takes wallpaper from the official Wizards of the Coast [website for Magic: The Gathering wallpaper](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/media/wallpapers).

This idea is based on [a previous C# program I wrote](https://github.com/goodtrailer/MTG-Wallpaper-OTW) that only worked specifically for Magic: The Gathering, and was not remotely user-friendly.
